# Autoupdating-Youtube-Video

Tom Scott made a fantastic video which showed the number of views the video had in the title. In the tutorial, I'm going to show you how Tom Scott put the number of views in his title and had it constantly updated. To show how many views a video has in the title, you need Google Scripts and some code which is linked in the LINKS section.

Moreover, you could also show the number of likes, dislikes, and comments in the title of the video which will dynamically update using the bot / script.

This unfortunately does not work for YouTube Brand accounts. Trust me, this video title would be way cooler if that was the case.
